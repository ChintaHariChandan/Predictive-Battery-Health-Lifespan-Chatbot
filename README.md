# Predictive-Battery-Health-Lifespan-Chatbot
*A Generative AI + Machine Learning System for Intelligent EV Battery Management*

## 🧠 Overview
The **Predictive Battery Health & Lifespan Chatbot** is an AI-powered assistant that predicts Electric Vehicle (EV) battery **State of Health (SoH)**, **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)**, and **failure likelihood** based on real-world telemetry data.  
It combines **predictive machine learning models** with a **Generative AI chatbot** to deliver human-like explanations, personalized tips, and actionable insights for better battery maintenance.

## 🌍 Project Motivation
Battery degradation is one of the key challenges in electric mobility.  
Traditional Battery Management Systems (BMS) monitor parameters but **lack predictive intelligence and user interpretability**.  
This project aims to:
- Predict **battery lifespan and health degradation** using machine learning.
- Provide **personalized conversational insights** through a Generative AI chatbot.
- Promote **sustainable EV usage** by helping users optimize charging and driving habits.
